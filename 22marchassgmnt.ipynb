    "Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose\n",
    "you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam\n",
    "scores. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    " To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (often denoted as \"r\") between two variables, such as\n",
    "the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, you need to follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Organize your data: Make a list of the paired data points, where each data point consists of a student's\n",
    "study time and their corresponding exam score.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the mean (average) of each variable:\n",
    "   - Calculate the mean of the study time.\n",
    "   - Calculate the mean of the exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the deviation of each data point from the mean:\n",
    "   - For each data point, subtract the mean of study time from the study time of that data point.\n",
    "   - Similarly, subtract the mean of exam scores from the exam score of that data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multiply the deviations of the two variables for each data point:\n",
    "   - Multiply the deviation of study time for a data point by the deviation of exam scores for the same\n",
    "data point. Do this for all data points and sum up these products.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate the sum of the squared deviations of each variable:\n",
    "   - Square the deviations of study time for all data points and sum them up.\n",
    "   - Square the deviations of exam scores for all data points and sum them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (r):\n",
    "-Divide the sum of the products of deviations (from step 4) by the square root of the product of the\n",
    "sum of squared deviations for both variables (from step 5). The formula for r is:\n",
    "     \n",
    "        r =   ∑(x− xˉ)(y− yˉ)/{sqrt (∑(x− xˉ)^2  ∑(y− yˉ)^2)}\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "     Here's how to interpret the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If r is close to 1 or -1, it indicates a strong linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "A value of 1 means a perfect positive linear relationship, while -1\n",
    "means a perfect negative linear relationship.\n",
    "- If r is close to 0, it suggests a weak or no linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- If r is 0.8, it suggests a strong positive linear relationship, indicating that as students \n",
    "spend more time studying, their exam scores tend to increase.\n",
    "- If r is -0.6, it suggests a moderate negative linear relationship, indicating that as students \n",
    "spend more time studying, their exam scores tend to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that correlation does not imply causation. A high correlation does not prove that one\n",
    "variable causes the other; it simply means they are related in a linear manner. Other factors could\n",
    "be at play, so further analysis may be needed to draw meaningful conclusions.   \n",

    "Q6. A company is interested in examining the relationship between the number of sales calls made per day\n",
    "and the number of sales made per week. The company collected data on both variables from a sample of\n",
    "30 sales representatives. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    " To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (often denoted as \"r\") between the number of sales calls \n",
    "    made per day and the number of sales made per week, you'll need the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The data for the number of sales calls made per day.\n",
    "2. The data for the number of sales made per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have this data, you can use the following formula to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    " r = frac{∑((X_i - xˉ)(Y_i - yˉ ))}/{sqrt{∑(X_i - xˉ)^2 ∑(Y_i - yˉ )^2}} \n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- X_i represents each value in the sales calls made per day.\n",
    "- Y_i represents each value in the sales made per week.\n",
    "-  xˉis the mean (average) of the sales calls made per day.\n",
    "- yˉ is the mean (average) of the sales made per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to calculate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean () of the sales calls made per day.\n",
    "2. Calculate the mean (yˉ) of the sales made per week.\n",
    "3. Calculate the numerator, which is the sum of the product of the differences between each data point\n",
    "and the respective mean for both variables.\n",
    "4. Calculate the denominator, which is the square root of the product of the sums of the squared\n",
    "differences between each data point and the respective mean for both variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step example calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have the following data for 30 sales representatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sales Calls Made per Day (X):\n",
    "- X1 = 10\n",
    "- X2 = 15\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- X30 = 12\n",
    "\n",
    "Sales Made per Week (Y):\n",
    "- Y1 = 5\n",
    "- Y2 = 7\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- Y30 = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the means:\n",
    "xˉ = (10 + 15 + ... + 12) / 30\n",
    "yˉ = (5 + 7 + ... + 6) / 30\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the numerator:\n",
    "Numerator = Σ[(Xi - xˉ )(Yi - yˉ)] for i = 1 to 30\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the denominators:\n",
    "Denominator_X = √[Σ(Xi - xˉ)^2] for i = 1 to 30\n",
    "Denominator_Y = √[Σ(Yi - yˉ )^2] for i = 1 to 30\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (r):\n",
    "r = frac{Numerator}{DenominatorX * DenominatorY}\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give you the Pearson correlation coefficient, which quantifies the strength and direction\n",
    "of the linear relationship between the two variables. The value of r will be between -1 \n",
    "(perfect negative correlation) and +1 (perfect positive correlation),\n",
    "with 0 indicating no linear correlation.\n",
    "      \n"
