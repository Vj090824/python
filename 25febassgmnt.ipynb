    "Q2. What is the difference between the functions loc and iloc in pandas.DataFrame?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In pandas, both the `loc` and `iloc` functions are used to access and manipulate data in \n",
    "    a DataFrame, but they have different ways of selecting data based on the index and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `loc` (Label-based Selection):\n",
    "   - `loc` is primarily used for label-based indexing. It allows you to select rows and columns\n",
    "by their labels (i.e., by their index names or column names).\n",
    "   - When using `loc`, you specify the row and column labels you want to select, and it returns\n",
    "    the data based on those labels.\n",
    "   - It includes the end label in the range when slicing. For example, `df.loc['A':'C']` will \n",
    "include rows 'A', 'B', and 'C'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]}, index=['X', 'Y', 'Z'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select a single element by label\n",
    "value = df.loc['X', 'A']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select a single column by label\n",
    "column = df.loc[:, 'B']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select rows by label range\n",
    "rows = df.loc['X':'Y']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select rows and specific columns by label\n",
    "subset = df.loc['X':'Y', ['A', 'B']]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `iloc` (Integer-based Selection):\n",
    "   - `iloc` is used for integer-based indexing. It allows you to select rows and columns\n",
    "by their integer positions, regardless of the labels.\n",
    "   - When using `iloc`, you specify the row and column positions you want to select,\n",
    "    and it returns the data based on those positions.\n",
    "   - It does not include the end position in the range when slicing. For example, \n",
    "`df.iloc[0:2]` will include rows at positions 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})\n",

    "# Select a single element by integer position\n",
    "value = df.iloc[0, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select a single column by integer position\n",
    "column = df.iloc[:, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select rows by integer position range\n",

    "# Select rows and specific columns by integer positions\n",
    "subset = df.iloc[0:2, [0, 1]]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the key difference between `loc` and `iloc` is the way they select data:\n",
    "- `loc` uses label-based selection, where you specify row and column labels.\n",
    "- `iloc` uses integer-based selection, where you specify row and column positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your choice between `loc` and `iloc` should depend on whether you want to access\n",

    "Now, let's analyze the difference between `new_df.loc[2]` and `new_df.iloc[2]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `new_df.loc[2]`: This code retrieves the row with label '2' from the `new_df` DataFrame. \n",
    "Since `reindex` has reordered the rows according to `[3, 0, 1, 2]`, \n",

    "functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In pandas, the term \"window functions\" generally refers to a group of functions that \n",
    "    allow you to perform various operations on a set of data points within a defined window\n",
    "    or window size. These functions are primarily used in conjunction with the `DataFrame`\n",
    "    or `Series` objects and are often employed in data analysis and manipulation tasks, \n",
    "    such as time series analysis and rolling calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common types of window functions in pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rolling Functions**: Rolling functions allow you to compute statistics, aggregates, \n",
    "or other operations over a rolling window of data points. You can specify the window size, \n",
    "and the function calculates the result for each window as it moves through the data.\n",
    "Common rolling functions include:\n",
    "   - `rolling().mean()`: Calculate the rolling mean.\n",
    "   - `rolling().sum()`: Calculate the rolling sum.\n",
    "   - `rolling().min()`: Calculate the rolling minimum.\n",
    "   - `rolling().max()`: Calculate the rolling maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expanding Functions**: Expanding functions compute the cumulative results over the\n",
    "entire data up to the current point. They do not use a fixed-size window but rather include\n",
    "all data up to the current row. Common expanding functions include:\n",
    "   - `expanding().mean()`: Calculate the expanding mean.\n",
    "   - `expanding().sum()`: Calculate the expanding sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exponentially Weighted Functions**: These functions calculate exponentially weighted \n",
    "statistics for a given data series. They assign exponentially decreasing weights to older\n",
    "data points, giving more importance to recent data. Common exponentially weighted functions include:\n",
    "   - `ewm().mean()`: Calculate the exponentially weighted moving average.\n",
    "   - `ewm().var()`: Calculate the exponentially weighted moving variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Groupby and Window Functions**: These functions combine the grouping and window operations. \n",
    "They allow you to apply window functions within each group of data.\n",
    "Common groupby and window functions include:\n",
    "   - `groupby().rolling().mean()`: Calculate rolling means within each group.\n",
    "   - `groupby().expanding().sum()`: Calculate expanding sums within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Shifting Functions**: Shifting functions allow you to shift data points within\n",
    "a Series or DataFrame. You can use these functions to create lead or lag values in your data.\n",
    "   - `shift()`: Shift the data by a specified number of periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Ranking Functions**: Ranking functions assign a rank to each element in a group or\n",
    "window based on a specified criterion. Common ranking functions include:\n",
    "   - `rank()`: Assign ranks to elements in a Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "These window functions are valuable for performing time-series analysis, \n",
    "calculating moving averages, identifying trends, and conducting various types of data \n",
    "transformations and aggregations within specific windows of your data.\n",
    "They provide a powerful toolset for data analysts and data scientists working with \n",
