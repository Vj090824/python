    "Q1. What is an activation function in the context of artificial neural networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "An activation function in the context of artificial neural networks is a mathematical function that determines \n",
    "the output of a neuron or node in a neural network based on its weighted inputs. These functions introduce \n",
    "non-linearity into the network, allowing it to model complex\n",
    "relationships in data and make neural networks capable of learning and representing a wide range of functions,\n",
    "including those that are not linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a neural network, each neuron receives inputs from the previous layer of neurons or from the input data.\n",
    "These inputs are weighted, meaning that they are multiplied by a certain weight value. The weighted sum of\n",
    "these inputs is then passed through an activation function, which produces the neuron's output or activation.\n",
    "This activation is then typically used as input for the neurons in the subsequent layer of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common activation functions in neural networks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sigmoid:** The sigmoid function maps the weighted sum of inputs to a value between 0 and 1. \n",
    "It was historically used in the hidden layers of neural networks but has been largely replaced by other\n",
    "activation functions like ReLU due to some of its limitations, such as vanishing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh):** The tanh function is similar to the sigmoid but maps the weighted sum to\n",
    "a value between -1 and 1. It addresses the vanishing gradient problem better than the sigmoid function but\n",
    "can still suffer from it in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU):** ReLU is one of the most widely used activation functions. \n",
    "It outputs the input directly if it's positive and zero otherwise. It helps address the vanishing\n",
    "gradient problem and is computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Leaky ReLU:** Leaky ReLU is a variation of ReLU that allows a small gradient when the input is negative.\n",
    "This helps prevent neurons from becoming \"dead\" during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parametric ReLU (PReLU):** PReLU is an extension of Leaky ReLU where the slope of the negative part\n",
    "is learned during training, rather than being a fixed constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Exponential Linear Unit (ELU):** ELU is another alternative to ReLU that has some advantages in \n",
    "terms of handling negative inputs and reducing the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of activation function can have a significant impact on the training and performance of\n",
    "a neural network, and different activation functions may be more suitable for different types of \n",
    "problems and architectures. Researchers and practitioners often experiment with various activation \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Activation functions are essential components of neural networks as they introduce non-linearity\n",
    "into the model, allowing it to learn complex relationships in data. Here are some common types of\n",
    "activation functions used in neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sigmoid**: The sigmoid function maps input values to a range between 0 and 1. It's often used \n",
    "in the output layer of binary classification problems because it can produce probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Formula: σ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)**: The tanh function maps input values to a range between -1 and 1. \n",
    "It is similar to the sigmoid but centered at zero, which can help in training deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Formula: tanh(x) = (e^(x) - e^(-x)) / (e^(x) + e^(-x))\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)**: ReLU is one of the most widely used activation functions. \n",
    "It outputs zero for negative inputs and passes through positive inputs unchanged,\n",
    "introducing non-linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Formula: ReLU(x) = max(0, x)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Leaky ReLU**: Leaky ReLU is a variant of ReLU that allows a small gradient for negative inputs,\n",
    "preventing the \"dying ReLU\" problem where neurons get stuck during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Formula: LeakyReLU(x) = max(αx, x) where α is a small positive constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parametric ReLU (PReLU)**: PReLU extends Leaky ReLU by making the slope of the negative part\n",
    "learnable during training rather than a fixed constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Formula: PReLU(x) = max(αx, x) where α is a learnable parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)**: ELU is another alternative to ReLU that avoids the dying ReLU problem.\n",
    "It has a smooth curve for negative inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Formula: ELU(x) = x if x >= 0; α(e^x - 1) if x < 0 where α is a positive constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Softmax**: The softmax function is commonly used in the output layer of multi-class classification problems.\n",
    "It converts a vector of raw scores into a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Formula: softmax(x)_i = e^(x_i) / Σ(e^(x_j)) for all j\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Swish**: Swish is a newer activation function that is similar to the sigmoid \n",

    "Q3. How do activation functions affect the training process and performance of a neural network?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions play a crucial role in the training process and performance of a neural network. \n",
    "They introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to model complex, non-linear \n",
    "relationships in the data. Here's \n",
    "how activation functions affect the training process and performance of a neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-Linearity**: Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the network. Without non-linearity, \n",
    "the entire neural network would be equivalent to a linear model, making it incapable of learning complex\n",
    "patterns in the data. Activation functions allow the network to approximate and learn non-linear functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gradient Flow**: During the training process, the backpropagation algorithm computes gradients to \n",
    "adjust the network's weights and biases. Activation functions impact the gradient flow through the network.\n",
    "Activation functions with well-behaved derivatives, such as ReLU, allow gradients to flow effectively\n",
    "and prevent vanishing gradients, which can slow down or prevent training in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vanishing and Exploding Gradients**: Some activation functions, like the sigmoid and tanh functions, \n",
    "are prone to vanishing gradients, especially in deep networks. This means that the gradients become extremely\n",
    "small as they propagate backward through many layers, making it difficult for earlier layers to learn.\n",
    "On the other hand, activation functions like the exponential linear unit (ELU) can help mitigate the\n",
    "vanishing gradient problem. Conversely, activation functions like the exponential function can lead \n",
    "to exploding gradients, making training unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convergence Speed**: Different activation functions can lead to differences in the convergence\n",
    "speed of a neural network. Activation functions like ReLU and its variants \n",
    "(e.g., Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU) are known to converge faster than functions like sigmoid or tanh.\n",
    "Faster convergence can significantly reduce training time and computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Expressiveness**: Activation functions also impact the expressiveness of the neural network.\n",
    "Some functions, like the sigmoid, squash input values to a limited range, while others, like ReLU,\n",
    "allow for a broader range of output values. This can affect the network's ability to represent complex functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Robustness to Overfitting**: The choice of activation function can influence the network's\n",
    "susceptibility to overfitting. Activation functions like dropout and variants of the ReLU family\n",
    "(e.g., dropout, dropout with Gaussian noise) can help regularize the network and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Compatibility with Data**: The choice of activation function should be based on the nature of \n",
    "the data and the problem you are trying to solve. For example, sigmoid and tanh functions may be\n",
    "suitable for binary classification problems, while ReLU-based functions are often preferred for\n",
    "deep neural networks in image and speech recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, activation functions are a critical component of neural networks, impacting their \n",
    "training process and overall performance. The choice of activation function should be made carefully \n",
    "based on the specific characteristics of the problem and the network \n",
    "architecture to achieve the best results.\n",

    "Q4. How does the sigmoid activation function work? What are its advantages and disadvantages?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The sigmoid activation function is a commonly used mathematical function in artificial neural networks.\n",
    "It takes an input value and squashes it into a range between 0 and 1.\n",
    "The formula for the sigmoid function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range:** The sigmoid function maps any input value to an output in the range (0, 1).\n",
    "This property makes it suitable for problems where the goal is to produce a probability-like output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Smoothness:** The sigmoid function is smooth and continuously differentiable, which makes it\n",
    "suitable for gradient-based optimization algorithms like gradient descent. This property helps in\n",
    "training neural networks effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Non-linearity:** It introduces non-linearity into the model. Neural networks use activation \n",
    "functions like sigmoid to model complex relationships in data, which is important for solving a\n",
    "wide range of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of the sigmoid activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Output Interpretability:** The sigmoid function's output can be interpreted as a probability, \n",
    "which is useful for binary classification problems. It's often used in the output layer of binary classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Smooth Gradient:** The sigmoid function has a smooth gradient, making it well-suited for \n",
    "gradient-based optimization algorithms like backpropagation, which is used for training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of the sigmoid activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vanishing Gradient Problem:** The sigmoid function suffers from the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "When the input values are very large or very small, the gradient of the sigmoid becomes extremely small\n",
    "leading to slow convergence during training. This can result in slow learning or\n",
    "getting stuck in local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Not Zero-Centered:** The sigmoid function is not zero-centered, meaning its output\n",
    "values are all positive. This can lead to issues in weight updates during training, \n",
    "especially in deep neural networks, as gradients can push weights in one direction, \n",
    "causing convergence issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Not Suitable for All Architectures:** While sigmoid activation is useful in certain cases\n",
    "like the output layer of binary classifiers, it's not the best choice for hidden layers in deep\n",
    "neural networks. Other activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) are often preferred \n",
    "for hidden layers due to their ability to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and faster convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the sigmoid activation function is a valuable tool in neural networks, \n",
    "especially in the output layer for binary classification problems. However, due to its vanishing\n",
    "gradient and lack of zero-centeredness, it may not be the best choice for all layers in deep networks,\n",
    "and alternative activation functions like ReLU are often preferred for hidden layers.\n",

    "Q5.What is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function? How does it differ from the sigmoid function?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is an activation function used in artificial neural networks. \n",
    "It is a simple yet effective non-linear activation function that has become widely popular \n",
    "in deep learning. The ReLU function is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "ReLU(x) = max(0, x)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, \"x\" represents the input to the activation function, and ReLU(x) returns the \n",
    "input itself if it's greater than or equal to zero; otherwise, it returns zero. In other words, \n",
    "if the input is positive or zero, ReLU outputs the input value, and if the input is negative, \n",
    "ReLU outputs zero. This results in a piecewise-linear, non-linear activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of the ReLU activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-linearity**: While ReLU is a simple function, it introduces non-linearity into the network,\n",
    "allowing it to learn complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sparsity**: ReLU activation can be sparse since it sets negative values to zero. \n",
    "Sparse activations can help in reducing overfitting and make the network more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vanishing Gradient**: Unlike sigmoid and tanh functions, ReLU doesn't saturate in the positive\n",
    "region. However, it can suffer from the \"dying ReLU\" problem, where neurons may become inactive\n",
    "(always output zero) during training, leading to dead gradients. This issue can be mitigated using \n",
    "variants of ReLU, such as Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's compare ReLU to the Sigmoid activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Output Range**:\n",
    "   - Sigmoid: The sigmoid function maps inputs to a range between 0 and 1. It has a smooth, S-shaped curve.\n",
    "   - ReLU: ReLU maps inputs to a range from 0 to positive infinity. It has a piecewise-linear shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linearity**:\n",
    "   - Sigmoid: The sigmoid function is smooth and continuously differentiable, but it can suffer\n",
    "from the vanishing gradient problem when gradients become extremely small for large or small inputs.\n",
    "   - ReLU: ReLU is piecewise-linear, which makes it less prone to the vanishing gradient \n",
    "    problem in the positive region.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sparsity**:\n",
    "   - Sigmoid: Sigmoid activations are not sparse; they produce values between 0 and 1 for all inputs.\n",
    "   - ReLU: ReLU activations can be sparse because they set negative inputs to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Computation Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - ReLU is computationally efficient to evaluate compared to the sigmoid function,\n",
    "which involves exponentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, ReLU has become the default choice for many neural network architectures because\n",
    "of its simplicity, efficiency, and ability to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem in \n",
    "deep networks. However, it's essential to be aware of potential issues\n",
    "like the dying ReLU problem and consider using variants like Leaky ReLU \n",
    "or Parametric ReLU if necessary.\n",

    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What are the benefits of using the ReLU activation function over the sigmoid function?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions offer several advantages over the \n",
    "    sigmoid activation function in neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mitigates the vanishing gradient problem: The sigmoid activation function squashes \n",
    "input values into the range [0, 1], making it prone to the vanishing gradient problem. \n",
    "When gradients become very small during backpropagation, it can impede training, particularly \n",
    "in deep networks. ReLU's simple linear behavior for positive inputs (f(x) = x for x > 0) \n",
    "allows gradients to flow more freely, alleviating the vanishing gradient issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Faster convergence: ReLU activations are computationally efficient. Their derivative is\n",
    "either 0 (for x < 0) or 1 (for x > 0), which simplifies gradient calculations. This typically\n",
    "results in faster convergence during training compared to the sigmoid function,\n",
    "which requires more complex calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sparse activations: ReLU neurons tend to be sparsely activated, meaning that many neurons \n",
    "remain inactive (outputting zero) for a given input. This sparsity can lead to more efficient \n",
    "representations and reduced model complexity, as opposed to the sigmoid function, which tends \n",
    "to produce distributed activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simplicity and scalability: ReLU is a simple activation function that does not involve exponentials\n",
    "(like the sigmoid and tanh functions), making it computationally more efficient. This simplicity makes \n",
    "it easier to train deep networks and scale them to larger sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Avoids the \"dying ReLU\" problem: While ReLU has its advantages, it can suffer from a problem known\n",
    "as the \"dying ReLU\" problem. Neurons with ReLU activations that always output zero for all inputs\n",
    "are essentially \"dead\" and do not contribute to learning. This typically occurs when large gradients \n",
    "flow through a ReLU neuron, causing its weights to update in such a way that it remains inactive. \n",
    "Variants like Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU were introduced to address this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Better performance in deep networks: ReLU activations are well-suited for deep neural networks. \n",
    "Their ability to mitigate vanishing gradients and their computational efficiency make them a popular\n",
    "choice in modern deep learning architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "While ReLU has these advantages, it's important to note that it's not always the best choice for\n",
    "every problem. Depending on the specific task, data distribution, and architecture, other activation\n",
    "functions like sigmoid, tanh, or variants of ReLU (e.g., Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU) may be more\n",

    "Q7. Explain the concept of \"leaky ReLU\" and how it addresses the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (Leaky ReLU) is a variant of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)\n",
    "activation function, commonly used in artificial neural networks. It was designed to address the\n",
    "vanishing gradient problem, which is a challenge encountered during the training of deep neural\n",
    "networks using gradient-based optimization algorithms like gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of Leaky ReLU and how it helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ReLU Activation Function (Recap):** The standard ReLU activation function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   f(x) = max(0, x)\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "   It is a simple and computationally efficient activation function that returns the input value if it is\n",
    "    positive and zero otherwise. ReLU has been widely used because it helps alleviate the vanishing gradient\n",
    "    problem to some extent by allowing gradients to flow through when the input is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vanishing Gradient Problem:** When training deep neural networks with many layers, the gradients\n",
    "during backpropagation can become very small as they are propagated backward through the network. \n",
    "This can cause the weights of earlier layers to update very slowly or not at all, \n",
    "effectively preventing the network from learning properly. The vanishing gradient problem is most \n",
    "pronounced when using activation functions like the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent (tanh).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Leaky ReLU:** To address the vanishing gradient problem, Leaky ReLU introduces a small,\n",
    "non-zero gradient for negative input values. It is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   f(x) = x if x > 0\n",
    "   f(x) = αx if x <= 0\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, α (usually a small positive constant, e.g., 0.01) is the \"leakiness\" parameter. When the input\n",
    "is greater than zero, Leaky ReLU behaves like the regular ReLU, allowing gradients to pass through unchanged.\n",
    "However, when the input is negative, it allows a small gradient (αx) to flow backward.\n",
    "This ensures that gradients don't completely vanish for negative inputs, and thus, earlier layers \n",
    "in the network can still receive some meaningful updates during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Benefits of Leaky ReLU:**\n",
    "   - Mitigates the vanishing gradient problem to some extent, making it easier to train deep networks.\n",
    "   - Introduces a degree of robustness against dead neurons (units that always output zero), which can\n",
    "occur in traditional ReLU when the weights are updated in such a way that\n",

    "Q8. What is the purpose of the softmax activation function? When is it commonly used?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The softmax activation function is commonly used in machine learning and deep learning for several purposes,\n",
    "with its primary role being to convert a vector of real \n",
    "numbers into a probability distribution. Here's a more detailed explanation of \n",
    "its purpose and common use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of Softmax Activation Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability Distribution:** The primary purpose of the softmax activation function is to transform a \n",
    "vector of real numbers (logits or scores) into a probability distribution over multiple classes. \n",
    "It does this by exponentiating each element of the input vector and then normalizing the results so \n",
    "that they sum to 1. This makes it suitable for multi-class classification problems where you want to \n",
    "assign an input to one of several possible classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-Class Classification:** Softmax is commonly used in the output layer of neural networks for\n",
    "multi-class classification tasks. After applying softmax to the network's raw output (logits),\n",
    "you get a set of class probabilities, and the class with the highest probability is typically\n",
    "chosen as the predicted class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Calculation:** In many machine learning models, particularly when using categorical\n",
    "cross-entropy loss, the softmax activation is used to compute the error or loss between\n",
    "predicted probabilities and true class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparing Model Outputs:** Softmax enables you to compare the relative strengths of\n",
    "predictions across multiple classes. This is helpful for understanding how confident the model\n",
    "is in its predictions and can be used for tasks like ranking or sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Image Classification:** In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), softmax is often used in\n",
    "the final layer to classify images into various categories or classes. This is a classic\n",
    "example of a multi-class classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Natural Language Processing:** In natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as\n",
    "text classification, sentiment analysis, or language modeling, softmax is used to predict \n",
    "the next word or classify text into different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning:** In some reinforcement learning algorithms, softmax is used \n",
    "to select actions probabilistically based on their expected values, which helps explore \n",
    "the action space during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recommendation Systems:** In recommendation systems, softmax can be used to calculate \n",
    "the probability of a user interacting with different items, allowing for \n",
    "personalized item recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the softmax activation function is a fundamental tool for converting raw scores \n",
    "into probabilities and is commonly used in machine learning and deep learning models for\n",
    "multi-class classification and probability-based decision-making tasks.\n",

    "Q9. What is the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function? How does it compare to the sigmoid function?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperbolic tangent, often abbreviated as \"tanh,\" is a popular activation function used \n",
    "in artificial neural networks. It's a non-linear function that maps its input to an output\n",
    "in the range of -1 to 1. Mathematically, the tanh function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "tanh(x) = \\frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}} \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the tanh function compares to the sigmoid function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range**:\n",
    "   - **Sigmoid**: The sigmoid function maps its input to an output in the range of 0 to 1.\n",
    "This makes it suitable for binary classification problems because it can squash any \n",
    "real-valued number into a probability-like range.\n",
    "   - **Tanh**: The tanh function maps its input to an output in the range of -1 to 1. \n",
    "    This means that it is centered around zero and can model both positive and negative values.\n",
    "    It's often used in situations where the data may have negative values or where the output\n",
    "    of the neural network needs to be zero-centered.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Zero-Centering**:\n",
    "   - **Sigmoid**: The sigmoid function is not zero-centered. This means that if the inputs to \n",
    "a layer of neurons are all positive or all negative, the outputs will tend to be biased towards \n",
    "one side of the sigmoid curve. This can lead to slow convergence during training.\n",
    "   - **Tanh**: The tanh function is zero-centered. This is beneficial for training neural \n",
    "    networks because it helps prevent the issues of vanishing gradients that can occur when \n",
    "    using non-zero-centered activation functions like the sigmoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Symmetry**:\n",
    "   - **Sigmoid**: The sigmoid function is asymmetric, with its maximum slope occurring \n",
    "at the origin (0, 0.5). This can cause issues during training when the input values are far from zero.\n",
    "   - **Tanh**: The tanh function is symmetric, with its maximum slope at the origin (0, 0).\n",
    "    This symmetry can help learning algorithms converge faster because gradients are more consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the tanh activation function is often preferred over the sigmoid function\n",
    "when designing neural networks because it addresses some of the limitations of the sigmoid, \n",
    "such as zero-centeredness and symmetric gradients. However, the choice of activation \n",
    "function depends on the specific problem and network architecture, and both sigmoid\n",
    "and tanh functions are still used in various scenarios. Additionally, more recent \n",
    "activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and its variants have gained \n",
    "popularity due to their computational efficiency and improved training characteristics.\n",
