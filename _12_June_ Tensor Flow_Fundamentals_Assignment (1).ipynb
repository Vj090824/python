    "1. What are the different data structures used in Tensorflow?. Give some examples\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "TensorFlow is a popular open-source machine learning framework primarily used for deep learning tasks.\n",
    "While TensorFlow itself is not primarily focused on data structures, \n",
    "it provides several data structures and abstractions\n",
    "that are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning. Here are some of the key data structures \n",
    "and examples of how they are used in TensorFlow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tensors**: Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays used as \n",
    "the fundamental data structure in TensorFlow. \n",
    "They can be constants or variables, and they are the building blocks for creating neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Creating a tensor\n",
    "   tensor_a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variables**: Variables are tensors whose values can be updated during training.\n",
    "They are commonly used to store\n",
    "the parameters (weights and biases) of a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   weight = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(input_size, output_size)))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Placeholders (Deprecated in TensorFlow 2.x)**: In older versions of TensorFlow (1.x), \n",
    "placeholders were used to feed \n",
    "data into the computational graph. However, in TensorFlow 2.x, they have been replaced by `tf.data` \n",
    "and other data input pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, input_size))\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sparse Tensors**: Sparse tensors are used to efficiently represent data with a lot of zeros. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are especially\n",
    "useful in natural language processing and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   sparse_tensor = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(indices=[[0, 1], [2, 3]], \n",
    "            values=[1.0, 2.0], dense_shape=[3, 4])\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ragged Tensors**: Ragged tensors represent data with non-uniform shapes,\n",
    "such as sequences of varying lengths.\n",
    "They are used in natural language processing for tasks like text tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ragged_tensor = tf.ragged.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]])\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Sparse Tensors**: Sparse tensors are used to represent tensors with a lot of\n",
    "zero values efficiently. They are essential\n",
    "for certain types of deep learning tasks, such as embeddings in recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   sparse_tensor = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(indices=[[0, 1], [1, 2]], \n",
    "            values=[1.0, 2.0], dense_shape=[2, 3])\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Data Structures for Neural Networks**: TensorFlow also provides high-level\n",
    "\n",
    "data structures like `tf.keras.Sequential` \n",
    "and `tf.keras.Model`, which allow you to define neural network architectures in a more abstract way.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   model = tf.keras.Sequential([\n",
    "       tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_size,)),\n",
    "       tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n",
    "   ])\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the primary data structures used in TensorFlow. \n",
    "The choice of data structure depends on the specific machine \n",
    "learning or deep learning task you are working on. TensorFlow provides\n",
    "a flexible and extensible framework to work with a wide\n",
    "range of data types and models. Note that the code examples provided are simplified \n",
    "for illustration purposes; in practice, TensorFlow code is \n",
    "often more complex and involves additional configuration \n",
    "for training and optimization.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",

    "2.How does the TensorFlow constant differ from a TensorFlow variable? Explain with an example\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "In TensorFlow, both constants and variables are used to represent data, \n",
    "but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TensorFlow Constant:**\n",
    "1. **Immutable:** Constants, as the name suggests, are immutable, meaning their value cannot be\n",
    "changed after they are initialized.\n",
    "2. **Used for Fixed Values:** Constants are typically used for \n",
    "storing fixed values like hyperparameters, \n",
    "configuration settings, or any value that remains constant throughout\n",
    "the execution of a TensorFlow graph.\n",
    "3. **Stored in the Graph:** Constants are stored directly in \n",
    "the computational graph, which means their \n",
    "values are part of the graph definition itself.\n",
    "4. **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a TensorFlow constant\n",
    "constant_value = tf.constant(5.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attempting to change the value will result in an error\n",
    "# constant_value = constant_value + 2.0  # This will raise an error\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `constant_value` is a TensorFlow constant with a value of 5.0.\n",
    "You cannot change this value once it's defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TensorFlow Variable:**\n",
    "1. **Mutable:** Variables are mutable, which means their values can be changed\n",
    "during the execution of a TensorFlow graph.\n",
    "2. **Used for Model Parameters:** Variables are typically used for \n",
    "model parameters such as weights and biases in \n",
    "machine learning models. These parameters need to be updated during training.\n",
    "3. **Stored Separately:** Variables are not stored in the computational graph;\n",
    "instead, they are stored separately \n",
    "and their values can be updated using TensorFlow operations.\n",
    "4. **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a TensorFlow variable\n",
    "initial_value = tf.constant(3.0)\n",
    "variable_value = tf.Variable(initial_value)\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can change the value of a variable using TensorFlow operations\n",
    "assign_op = variable_value.assign(5.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Running the session to update the variable's value\n",
    "with tf.Session() as sess:\n",
    "    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())\n",
    "    sess.run(assign_op)\n",
    "    updated_value = sess.run(variable_value)\n",
    "    print(\"Updated Variable Value:\", updated_value)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `variable_value` is a TensorFlow variable initially set to 3.0,\n",
    "but its value is changed to 5.0 using the `assign` operation. \n",
    "Variables are typically used for things like model weights, \n",
    "which need to be updated during training\n",
    "to optimize the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between TensorFlow constants and variables \n",
    "lies in their mutability and usage. \n",
    "Constants are immutable and used for fixed values, while variables are mutable\n",
    "and used for values that need to\n",
    "be updated during the execution of a TensorFlow graph, such as model parameters.    \n",

    "3.Describe the process of matrix addition, multiplication, and elementDwise operations in TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "In TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework developed by Google,\n",
    "you can perform various matrix operations,\n",
    "including addition, multiplication, and element-wise operations, \n",
    "using its computational graph-based approach.\n",
    "Here's a brief overview of each of these operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Matrix Addition:**\n",
    "   Matrix addition in TensorFlow is straightforward and follows the basic rules of linear algebra. \n",
    "    To add two matrices, they must have the same dimensions (same number of rows and columns).\n",
    "    You can use TensorFlow's functions to perform matrix addition. Here's how it's done:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Define two matrices\n",
    "   matrix_A = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "   matrix_B = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Perform matrix addition\n",
    "   result = tf.add(matrix_A, matrix_B)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Run a TensorFlow session to compute the result\n",
    "   with tf.Session() as sess:\n",
    "       addition_result = sess.run(result)\n",
    "       print(addition_result)\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `tf.add()` is used to perform element-wise addition of the two matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Matrix Multiplication:**\n",
    "   Matrix multiplication in TensorFlow can be done using the `tf.matmul()` function.\n",
    "    TensorFlow also provides the `@` \n",
    "    operator for matrix multiplication. When multiplying matrices, make sure that \n",
    "    the number of columns in the first\n",
    "    matrix matches the number of rows in the second matrix. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Define two matrices\n",
    "   matrix_A = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "   matrix_B = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Perform matrix multiplication\n",
    "   result = tf.matmul(matrix_A, matrix_B)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Run a TensorFlow session to compute the result\n",
    "   with tf.Session() as sess:\n",
    "       multiplication_result = sess.run(result)\n",
    "       print(multiplication_result)\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Element-wise Operations:**\n",
    "   Element-wise operations are operations that are performed independently \n",
    "    on each element of a matrix or tensor. \n",
    "    TensorFlow allows you to perform element-wise operations using basic\n",
    "    arithmetic operators or specialized functions. \n",
    "    Here's an example of some element-wise operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Define a matrix\n",
    "   matrix = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Element-wise addition\n",
    "   addition_result = matrix + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Element-wise multiplication\n",
    "   multiplication_result = matrix * 2\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Element-wise square root\n",
    "   sqrt_result = tf.sqrt(matrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Run a TensorFlow session to compute the results\n",
    "   with tf.Session() as sess:\n",
    "addition_result, multiplication_result, sqrt_result = sess.run(\n",
    "    [addition_result, multiplication_result, sqrt_result])\n",
    "       print(\"Element-wise Addition:\\n\", addition_result)\n",
    "       print(\"Element-wise Multiplication:\\n\", multiplication_result)\n",
    "       print(\"Element-wise Square Root:\\n\", sqrt_result)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " In this example, the operations are performed element-wise on the matrix, resulting in new matrices\n",
    "with the same dimensions as the original but with the specified operations applied to each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basic operations for working with matrices and tensors in TensorFlow.\n",
    "TensorFlow's flexibility and efficiency make it a powerful tool for performing various \n",
    "mathematical operations on tensors, which are \n",
    "fundamental to deep learning and machine learning applications.    \n",
    "    \n",
