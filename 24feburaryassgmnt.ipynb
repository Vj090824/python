    "\n",
    "# Generate summary statistics for numeric columns\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of data manipulation with Pandas, `DataFrame.size` and `DataFrame.shape`\n",
    "are two different attributes that provide information about the dimensions of a DataFrame, \n",
    "but they serve different purposes and return different values:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `DataFrame.size`:\n",
    "   - `DataFrame.size` returns the total number of elements (cells) in the DataFrame.\n",
    "   - It calculates the size by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns.\n",
    "   - The result is an integer representing the total number of data points in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",

    "print(df_size)  # Output: 6 (2 rows * 3 columns = 6)\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `DataFrame.shape`:\n",
    "   - `DataFrame.shape` returns a tuple that represents the dimensions of the DataFrame.\n",
    "   - The tuple contains two values: the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively.\n",
    "   - It provides a convenient way to determine the shape (size) of the\n",
