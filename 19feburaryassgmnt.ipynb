    "Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight and micro web framework for Python. \n",
    "It is designed to make it easy to build web applications and APIs quickly \n",
    "and with minimal boilerplate code. Flask is known for its simplicity, flexibility, \n",
    "and ease of use, making it a popular choice for developers who want to create \n",
    "web applications with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key advantages of Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lightweight: Flask is a micro-framework, which means it provides the basic tools \n",
    "and components needed for web development without imposing a lot of structure or \n",
    "unnecessary features. This lightweight nature allows developers to choose and \n",
    "integrate the specific libraries and components they need for their project, \n",
    "making Flask highly customizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simplicity: Flask follows the \"micro\" philosophy, which means it provides only \n",
    "the essentials for building web applications. This simplicity makes it easy for \n",
    "developers to understand and work with Flask, especially for small to medium-sized projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexibility: Flask doesn't dictate how you should structure your application,\n",
    "giving you the freedom to organize your code and project layout as you see fit. \n",
    "You can choose your database, templating engine, and other components, allowing \n",
    "you to use the tools that best suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extensibility: Flask has a rich ecosystem of extensions and libraries that can \n",
    "be easily integrated into your application. These extensions can add functionality\n",
    "for tasks like authentication, database integration, API development, and more, \n",
    "saving you time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Minimal Boilerplate: Flask reduces boilerplate code, making it quick to get started \n",
    "with web development. You can create a basic web application with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Community and Documentation: Flask has an active and supportive community of developers, \n",
    "which means you can find a wealth of resources, tutorials, and documentation to help you\n",
    "learn and solve problems. The official Flask documentation is well-maintained and comprehensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. RESTful APIs: Flask is commonly used for building RESTful APIs due to its simplicity and \n",
    "ease of creating routes and handling HTTP methods. It's a popular choice for developing \n",
    "backend services for web and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Testing: Flask is designed with testing in mind, making it relatively easy to write unit \n",
    "tests and integration tests for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Deployment: Flask can be deployed on various hosting platforms and web servers. It doesn't \n",
    "impose any specific deployment model, allowing you to choose the hosting and deployment \n",
    "strategy that suits your project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Pythonic: Since Flask is written in Python, it follows Python's coding conventions\n",
    "and idioms, making it a natural choice for Python developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Flask is an excellent choice for developers who value simplicity, flexibility,\n",
    "and a minimalistic approach to web development. It's particularly well-suited for prototyping,\n",

    "Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In Flask, app routing refers to the process of defining the routes or URLs that your web\n",
    "    application will respond to. Routes determine how your Flask application will handle \n",
    "    incoming HTTP requests. Flask uses the concept of \"app routes\" to map specific URLs \n",
    "    to Python functions, allowing you to create dynamic and interactive web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of how app routing works in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **URL Routing**: When a user or client makes an HTTP request to your Flask application, \n",
    "such as visiting a webpage or submitting a form, Flask needs to determine which Python \n",
    "function should handle that request. This mapping is achieved using app routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **@app.route Decorator**: To define a route in Flask, you typically use the `@app.route`\n",
    "decorator. This decorator associates a URL pattern (route) with \n",
    "a Python function (view function). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "   app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "   @app.route('/')\n",
    "   def home():\n",
    "       return 'Welcome to the home page!'\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, when a user visits the root URL (\"/\") of your application, the\n",
    "`home` function will be called, and the string \"Welcome to the home page!\" will\n",
    "be displayed in their browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Routes**: Flask allows you to create dynamic routes by including variables\n",
    "in the URL pattern. These variables can be extracted and used in your view functions. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   @app.route('/user/<username>')\n",
    "   def show_user(username):\n",
    "       return f'User Profile: {username}'\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, if a user visits a URL like \"/user/johndoe,\" the `show_user` function will receive \n",
    "    \"johndoe\" as the `username` parameter and display \"User Profile: johndoe.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **HTTP Methods**: You can specify which HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) a\n",
    "route should respond to by providing the `methods` parameter to the `@app.route` decorator. \n",
    "For example, to handle both GET and POST requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   @app.route('/submit', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n",
    "   def submit_form():\n",
    "       # Handle form submission logic here\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Why Use App Routes**: App routes are essential in Flask for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - They provide a clear and organized way to define the behavior of your web application \n",
    "for different URLs and HTTP methods.\n",
    "   - They allow for the creation of dynamic and parameterized routes, enabling you to build \n",
    "    flexible and data-driven web applications.\n",
    "   - They help maintain separation of concerns in your code, as each route corresponds to a \n",
    "specific functionality or view.\n",
    "   - They make it easy to implement RESTful APIs by defining routes \n",
    "    for different resource endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, app routing is a fundamental concept in Flask that enables you to define how your \n",
    "web application responds to different URLs and HTTP requests, making it a powerful tool\n",
    "for building web applications and APIs.   \n",
    "    \n",

    "Attach the screenshot of the output in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "using a popular web framework like Flask in Python. \n",
    "Here's an example of how you can create these routes:\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",

    "    return \"\"\"\n",
    "    Company Name: ABC Corporation\n",
    "    Location: India\n",

    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, we import the Flask framework, create a Flask application,\n",
    "and define two routes. The `/` route displays the company details when you \n",
    "access the root URL of your application, and the `/welcome` route displays the\n",
    "welcome message when you access `/welcome`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run this code on your local development environment, and when you access \n",
    "the specified routes, you'll see the desired messages. To take a screenshot, you can\n",
    "use your operating system's built-in screenshot tools or a third-party screenshot application.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, the `url_for()` function is used for URL building. It generates a URL for a \n",
