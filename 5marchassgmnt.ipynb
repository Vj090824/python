    "Q1. How can you create a Bokeh plot using Python code?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a Bokeh plot in Python using the Bokeh library, which is a popular tool for \n",
    "creating interactive and visually appealing data visualizations. Here's a step-by-step guide \n",
    "on how to create a simple Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Bokeh**: If you haven't already installed Bokeh, you can do so using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   pip install bokeh\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import Necessary Modules**: In your Python script or Jupyter Notebook,\n",
    "import the necessary modules from Bokeh:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   from bokeh.plotting import figure, output_file, show\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prepare Data**: Prepare your data that you want to visualize. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "   y = [6, 7, 2, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create a Bokeh Figure**: Create a Bokeh `figure` object to define the properties of your plot,\n",
    "such as title, axis labels, and more:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   p = figure(title=\"Simple Bokeh Plot\", x_axis_label=\"X-axis\", y_axis_label=\"Y-axis\")\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Add Data to the Plot**: Add your data to the figure using the `circle` method\n",
    "(or other glyphs for different types of plots):\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   p.circle(x, y, size=10, color=\"blue\", alpha=0.5)\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Specify Output File (Optional)**: If you want to save the plot as an HTML file,\n",
    "you can use the `output_file` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   output_file(\"bokeh_plot.html\")\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "   If you don't specify this, Bokeh will display the plot in the Jupyter Notebook or in a \n",
    "    separate browser window, depending on your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Display the Plot**: Use the `show` function to display the plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   show(p)\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    " When you run the script or notebook cells, you should see your Bokeh plot displayed. \n",
    "If you specified an output file, you'll find an HTML file with the plot in your working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a basic example of creating a Bokeh plot. Bokeh offers many customization options\n",
    "for creating more complex and interactive plots, including line plots, bar charts, heatmaps,\n",
    "and more. You can refer to the Bokeh documentation (https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html)\n",
    "for more details and examples on how to create different\n",
    "types of plots and customize their appearance and interactivity.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are glyphs in Bokeh, and how can you add them to a Bokeh plot? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bokeh, glyphs are visual markers or shapes that you can use to represent\n",
    "data points in a plot. Glyphs can be points, lines, bars, wedges, patches,\n",
    "\n",
    "and more. They are the building blocks for creating visualizations in Bokeh.\n",
    "To add glyphs to a Bokeh plot, you typically use the `figure` object to create a plot \n",
    "canvas, and then you use glyph functions to specify the type of glyph you want to add \n",
    "and provide data to populate the glyph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to add glyphs to a Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a sample dataset\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'x_values': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n",
    "    'y_values': [2, 4, 1, 3, 5],\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a ColumnDataSource to hold the data\n",
    "source = ColumnDataSource(data=data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a Bokeh figure\n",
    "p = figure(title=\"Scatter Plot Example\", x_axis_label=\"X-axis\", y_axis_label=\"Y-axis\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a circle glyph to represent data points\n",
    "p.circle(x='x_values', y='y_values', size=10, source=source, color='blue', \n",
    "         legend_label=\"Data Points\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a line glyph to connect the data points\n",
    "p.line(x='x_values', y='y_values', line_width=2, source=source, color='red', \n",
    "       legend_label=\"Line\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a text glyph to label data points\n",
    "labels = LabelSet(x='x_values', y='y_values', text='x_values', level='glyph',\n",
    "                  source=source, x_offset=-10, y_offset=5)\n",
    "p.add_layout(labels)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Customize the plot appearance\n",
    "p.legend.title = \"Legend\"\n",
    "p.legend.label_text_font_size = \"12pt\"\n",
    "p.legend.label_text_color = \"navy\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the plot\n",
    "show(p)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We create a sample dataset containing 'x_values' and 'y_values'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We use `ColumnDataSource` to create a data source from the dataset. \n",
    "This allows us to efficiently share data between glyphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We create a Bokeh figure (`p`) and add three different glyphs:\n",
    "   - `circle` for individual data points.\n",
    "   - `line` to connect the data points.\n",
    "   - `text` to label the data points with their x-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We customize the appearance of the plot by adding a legend and modifying legend properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, we use `show(p)` to display the Bokeh plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize various aspects of the glyphs such as size, color, \n",
    "and style to create rich and informative visualizations in Bokeh.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Q3. How can you customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot, including the axes, title, and legend?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot, including the axes, title, and legend, by\n",
    "using various customization options provided by the Bokeh library in Python. Bokeh is a \n",
    "versatile library for creating interactive and visually appealing plots.\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step guide on how to customize different aspects of a Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import the necessary libraries**:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to import the Bokeh library and create a figure object to start customizing your plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a figure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Create a figure object that represents your plot. You can specify various attributes, \n",
    "such as plot width, height, and other optional parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "p = figure(width=500, height=400, title=\"Customized Bokeh Plot\")\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customize the axes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Customize the appearance of the axes using the `axis` attributes of the figure object.\n",
    "For example, you can set the axis labels, ticks, and their properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   p.xaxis.axis_label = \"X-axis Label\"\n",
    "   p.yaxis.axis_label = \"Y-axis Label\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Customize axis ticks\n",
    "   p.xaxis.major_label_text_color = \"blue\"\n",
    "   p.yaxis.major_label_text_font_style = \"italic\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Customize the title**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can set the title of the plot and customize its appearance using the \n",
    "`title` attribute of the figure object.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   p.title.text = \"Customized Title\"\n",
    "   p.title.text_font_size = \"16pt\"\n",
    "   p.title.align = \"center\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Customize the legend**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you have multiple data series and want to include a legend, you can customize \n",
    "it using the `legend` attribute of the plot's renderers (e.g., line, scatter, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Assuming you have a line plot with a legend\n",
    "   p.line(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[4, 5, 6], legend_label=\"Line 1\", line_color=\"red\")\n",
    "   p.line(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[6, 5, 4], legend_label=\"Line 2\", line_color=\"blue\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Customize the legend\n",
    "   p.legend.title = \"Legend\"\n",
    "   p.legend.label_text_font_style = \"bold\"\n",
    "   p.legend.label_text_color = \"green\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Show the plot**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Finally, you can display the customized plot using the `show` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   show(p)\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    " This code provides a basic outline for customizing the appearance of a Bokeh plot, \n",
    "including the axes, title, and legend. You can further customize other aspects such\n",
    "as colors, line styles, markers, and more based on your specific requirements.\n",
    "Bokeh provides extensive customization options to create visually appealing\n",
    "and interactive plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Q4. What is a Bokeh server, and how can you use it to create interactive plots\n",
    "that can be updated in real time?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bokeh is an open-source Python library for creating interactive and visually\n",
    "appealing data visualizations, including plots, charts, and dashboards.\n",
    "Bokeh includes a server component called the \"Bokeh Server,\" which allows you to build \n",
    "interactive web applications that can update in real-time based on user interactions or \n",
    "data changes. Here's an overview of\n",
    "what Bokeh Server is and how you can use it to create interactive plots that update in real-time:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bokeh Library**: Before you can use the Bokeh Server, you need to have the Bokeh\n",
    "library installed. You can typically install it using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   pip install bokeh\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understanding Bokeh Plots**: Bokeh provides a high-level interface for creating\n",
    "various types of plots, such as line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, and more. \n",
    "You can define your plots using Python code, and Bokeh takes care of \n",
    "rendering them in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bokeh Server**: The Bokeh Server is an extension of the Bokeh library that enables\n",
    "you to create dynamic and interactive web applications. With the server, you can build \n",
    "applications that allow users to interact with your plots in real-time. For example,\n",
    "users can zoom, pan, filter data, or trigger updates based on their actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating a Bokeh Server Application**: To create a Bokeh Server application, \n",
    "you typically create a Python script that defines your plot(s) and specifies how they \n",
    "should update in response to user interactions or changes in the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adding Callbacks**: Callbacks are Python functions that you can attach to Bokeh \n",
    "widgets (e.g., buttons, sliders, dropdowns) or data sources. These callbacks define what\n",
    "should happen when a user interacts with the widget or when new data is available.\n",
    "For example, you can define a callback that updates a plot when a button is clicked \n",
    "or when new data arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Launching the Bokeh Server**: To run your Bokeh Server application, you use the \n",
    "`bokeh serve` command followed by the name of your Python script:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "bokeh serve your_app.py\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "This command starts a Bokeh Server instance and makes your application accessible via a web URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Accessing the Application**: Users can access your Bokeh Server application through\n",
    "a web browser by navigating to the provided URL. They can then interact with the plot(s) \n",
    "in real-time based on the defined callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Updating in Real-Time**: Any interactions or changes made by users or external data \n",
    "sources trigger updates in the Bokeh Server application. This allows you to create dynamic\n",
    "and responsive visualizations that reflect the latest data or user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a Bokeh Server is a component of the Bokeh library that allows you to build \n",
    "interactive web applications with real-time updates. You can create these applications \n",
    "by defining plots, adding interactive widgets, and specifying callbacks that determine \n",
    "how the plots should react to user interactions or data changes. This makes Bokeh Server \n",
    "a powerful tool for building data dashboards, monitoring systems, and other applications \n",
    "that require dynamic visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Q5. How can you embed a Bokeh plot into a web page or dashboard using Flask or Django?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "To embed a Bokeh plot into a web page or dashboard using Flask or Django, you'll need \n",
    "to follow a set of steps to create the plot, render it, and integrate it with your \n",
    "web framework. Below, I'll provide you with a step-by-step guide for both Flask and Django:\n",
