    "**Step 1: Create a New Folder for Your Project**\n",
    "First, create a folder where you want to organize your machine learning project.\n",
    "You can do this manually or using terminal commands. For example, you can create a folder called\n",

    "This command will create a hidden `.git` directory in your project folder, which is where\n",
    "Git will store its configuration and version history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Create Your Machine Learning Project Files**\n",
    "Now, you can create your machine learning project files. In this example, you'll create \n",

    "**Step 3: Create a Separate Virtual Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good practice to create a separate virtual environment for your project to\n",
    "isolate its dependencies from your base environment. You can use `venv` or `conda` for this. \n",
    "Here's an example using `venv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
