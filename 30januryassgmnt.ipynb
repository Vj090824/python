    "5. Why and When to Use while Loop in Python give a detailed description with example\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A `while` loop in Python is a control flow structure that allows you to repeatedly execute a block\n",
    "    of code as long as a specified condition is evaluated as `True`. This means that the code within the \n",
    "    loop will keep running until the condition becomes `False`. `while` loops are useful when you need to\n",
    "    repeat a task until a certain condition is met or until a certain criteria is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed description of when and why to use `while` loops in Python along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use `while` Loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When you don't know the exact number of iterations:** `while` loops are used when you are uncertain\n",
    "about the number of times a loop needs to execute. Unlike `for` loops that have a predetermined number of \n",
    "iterations, `while` loops allow you to keep looping until a particular condition is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterating until a specific condition is met:** You can use `while` loops when you want to repeatedly\n",
    "execute a block of code until a certain condition becomes `False`. This can be helpful for tasks like \n",
    "searching for a particular item in a list, waiting for user input, or running a game loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Continuous execution:** If you need a loop that keeps running indefinitely, you can achieve this with\n",
    "a `while` loop by setting the loop condition to `True`. This is often used for server applications, daemons,\n",
    "or programs that run continuously until they are manually stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Using `while` Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to write a program that asks the user for a number and keeps asking until the user enters\n",
    "a positive integer. Here's how you can use a `while` loop to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    user_input = input(\"Enter a positive integer: \")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Check if the input is a positive integer\n",
    "    if user_input.isdigit() and int(user_input) > 0:\n",
    "        break  # Exit the loop if the condition is met\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"You entered: {user_input}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We start with an infinite `while` loop by setting the loop condition to `True`.\n",
    "- Inside the loop, we take user input and check whether it's a positive integer.\n",
    "- If the user enters a valid positive integer, we use the `break` statement to exit the loop.\n",
    "- If the input is not a positive integer, we provide feedback and continue the loop until a valid input is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "This program will keep asking the user for input until a positive integer is entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that when using `while` loops, it's essential to ensure that the loop condition \n",
    "eventually becomes `False` to avoid infinite loops and make your program responsive.\n",
    "You should have a mechanism within the loop that updates the condition or \n",
    "use a `break` statement to exit the loop when the desired condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use nested while loop to print 3 different pattern.\n",
    "\n",

    "        j += 1\n",
    "    print()\n",
    "    i += 1\n",

    "        j += 1\n",
    "    print()\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern 3: Inverted Right Triangle\n",
    "\n",
    "n = 5\n",
    "i = n\n",
    "while i >= 1:\n",

    "    while j <= i:\n",

    "        j += 1\n",
