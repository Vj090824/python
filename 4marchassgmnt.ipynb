    "# Show the plot\n",
    "fig.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We import `plotly.express` as `px`.\n",
    "2. We define some sample data in the `data` list.\n",
    "3. We create a distribution plot using `px.histogram()`, passing in the data, the variable \n",
    "to plot (`x=data`), and the number of bins (`nbins=10`). We also set the opacity of the \n",
    "bars and give the plot a title.\n",
    "4. We use `fig.update_traces()` to add a KDE overlay to the histogram. Setting \n",
    "`histnorm='probability density'` scales the histogram bars to represent the probability density,\n",
    "and `marker_line_width=0` and `marker_line_color=\"black\"` remove the outline around the bars.\n",
    "5. Finally, we display the plot using `fig.show()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will generate a distribution plot with a histogram and KDE overlaid on top of it,\n",
